      The Monty Hall Problem is a statistical problem based off of a game played
      on an American TV show named "Lets Make a Deal", which aired during the
      1960's and 70's. The problem actually gets its name from the host, Monty
      Hall (shown to the left). The problem was first answered by Marilyn vos
      Savant (shown to the right) in her weekly printed column of <i> Parade </i>
      titled "Ask Marilyn". Her answer sparked debate from thousands of readers,
      and was even featured in an article on the front page of <i> The New York
      Times </i>. Eventually it was proven that her original answer (which will
      be discussed below) was correct!

      Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors.
      Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say
      #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door,
      say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, "Do you want to pick door #2?"
      Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?
