      The Monty Hall Problem is a statistical problem based off of a game played
      on an American TV show named "Lets Make a Deal", which aired during the
      1960's and 70's. The problem actually gets its name from the host, Monty
      Hall (shown to the left). The problem was first answered by Marilyn vos
      Savant (shown to the right) in her weekly printed column of <i> Parade </i>
      titled "Ask Marilyn". Her answer sparked debate from thousands of readers,
      and was even featured in an article on the front page of <i> The New York
      Times </i>. Eventually it was proven that her original answer (which will
      be discussed below) was correct!

<h2> - The Problem - </h2>

      The question Marilyn was originally asked on her column in 1990, which eventually
      became known as the Monty Hall Problem, is as followed: <br><br>
      <b>
      "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors.
      Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say
      #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door,
      say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, "Do you want to pick door #2?"
      Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?"</b> <br/> <br/>

      The answer to the Monty Hall Problem is that it is always better to switch
      doors, under the assumption that the door being revealed to you always has
      a goat behind it. In fact, by always switching doors, the player has a <b>
      two-thirds chance of winning </b>, as opposed to the <b> one-thirds chance
      of winning </b> using the never switching doors strategy. The simulation
      will attempt to replicate these results over many games played.

<h2> - Motivation - </h2>
<div class="Motivation-cont">
  <div class="MotivationPar">
    <p style="padding-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">
      I had first heard about the Monty Hall Problem during a Game Theory
      lecture relatively early on in the semester. After hearing the answer, I
      was confused as to why always switching doors is the better strategy.
      I realized early on that writing a program to simulate the game can help
      demonstrate its results. More specifically, the simulation will do so by
      running the Monty Hall game using two opposing strategies and compare the
      results of the two. The first strategy is to <b> never switch doors </b>,
      while the other strategy is to <b> always switch doors </b>. The long-term
      behavior of the simulation, i.e., after many games have been played, should
      be consistent with the results described above in "The Problem" section.
      Ultimately, through programming the simulation I hoped to achieve two goals:
      <ol>
         <li>
           Develop an intuitive understanding of the answer to the Monty Hall
           Problem in addition to the answer involving Game Theory concepts
           learned.
         </li> <br>
         <li>
           Run the simulation hundreds, even thousands, of times in a relatively
           short amount of time to observe the long-term behavior. This behavior
           will then be compared to the actual results of the problem.
         </li>
      </ol>

  <div class="Instructions">
    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p>
      To run a simulation, simply enter an integer number of games to simulate
      and click the "Run Simulation!" button. <br> <br>

      Each game will be
      simulated once using the <b>Never Switching Strategy</b> and once using the
      <b>Always Switching Strategy</b>. The number of cumulative wins as well as a
      cumulative win percentage, for both strategies is displayed. <br> <br>

      You may stop the simulation using the "Stop Simulation" button, but once
      the simulation is stopped it <b> MAY NOT </b> be resumed again.
